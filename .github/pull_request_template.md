### PR Tips

- The title should be "package: description".
For example, "mcp: rename LoggingMessage to Log".
For more pervasive changes, use "all" instead of a package name.

- The commit message should provide context (why this commit?) and describe the changes
  at a high level. Changes that are obvious from the diffs don't need to be mentioned.

- Mention related issues with 'For #NNN' or 'Fixes #NNN' at the end of the commit message.

- Look for PRs similar to yours in the log of this repo, or the Go repo (github.com/golang/go).
