### Go.AllowList template
# Allowlisting gitignore template for GO projects prevents us
# from adding various unwanted local files, such as generated
# files, developer configurations or IDE-specific files etc.
#
# Recommended: Go.AllowList.gitignore

# Ignore everything
*

# But not these files...
