# "Warts" - API oversights to reconsider for v2

This file collects a list of API oversights or rough edges that we've uncovered
post v1.0, both to address them a potential future v2, and to document their
current workarounds.

- `EventStore.Open` is unnecessary. This was an artifact of an earlier version
  of the SDK where event persistence and delivery were combined.

  **Workaround**: `Open` may be implemented as a no-op.

- `ClientCapabilities.Roots` should have been a distinguished struct pointer.
  This was simply an oversight.

  **Workaround**: the `ClientCapabilities.Roots.Supported` field is managed by
  custom marshaling of `ClientCapabilities`.
