# MCP Go SDK Roadmap

## Current focus

The following items are planned for the next release (v1.4.0):

- **SEP-1730: Tier 1 SDK support** (https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/issues/675)
  - Description: We aim to be rated as Tier 1 SDK.
- **SEP-1577: support Sampling With Tools** (https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/issues/629)
  - Description: Sampling with Tools is the last SEP to be implemented
    to implement the full scope of 2025-11-25 MCP specification.
- **OAuth Support** (https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/issues/19)
  - Description: Client-side OAuth support is the last feature
    needed to provide the Authorization solution as per specification.

our long-term strategy. It may include experimental features or extensions
